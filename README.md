# Multiple Disease Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on predicting multiple diseases, including Breast Cancer, Diabetes, and Heart Disease. The project utilizes various algorithms and techniques to provide accurate predictions based on input data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the models is included in this repository. 

Please download the datasets and place them in the appropriate directories before running the application.


   
To launch the Streamlit application, execute the following command:

```
streamlit run multiple_disease_pred.py
```

This will start the application, and you can access it by opening the provided URL in your web browser.

## Model Training

The project uses machine learning algorithms to train models for disease prediction. The models have already been trained and saved with '.sav' extension, so training is not necessary unless you want to experiment with different algorithms or techniques.

However, if you wish to train the models from scratch, you can execute the training scripts provided for each disease:

- `breast_cancer.ipynb`: Trains the Breast Cancer prediction model.
- `diabetes_pred.ipynb`: Trains the Diabetes prediction model.
- `heart.ipynb`: Trains the Heart Disease prediction model.

Please note that training models may require a significant amount of time and computational resources, depending on your machine.


- Inspiration and knowledge gained from various machine learning resources and tutorials.
